# 🚀 Customer Churn Prediction Model 📊

## 🌟 Overview

Welcome to the **Customer Churn Prediction Model**! This project predicts customer churn using the **IBM Telecom Customer Dataset**. By harnessing the power of machine learning models like **Random Forest**, **XGBoost**, and **Decision Trees**, this tool helps businesses predict which customers are at risk of leaving. Deployed via **Flask**, it provides real-time predictions, helping companies retain their valuable customers!
